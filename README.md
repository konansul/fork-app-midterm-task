# Forkio Web App — Midterm Project

This project is a front-end implementation of the “Forkio” web application design provided in Figma, as part of the midterm task. The goal of this project is to reproduce a multi-section landing page using only HTML, CSS, and static assets, accurately following the layout and positioning from the given Figma template.

## Objectives
Convert the provided Figma mockup into a functional and responsive HTML/CSS page. Maintain pixel-perfect alignment and styling consistency with the design. Organize the project into clear, modular folders for maintainability. Adhere to modern web standards and clean code principles.

## Design Reference

The visual layout and component structure of this project are based on the official Forkio Figma design, accessible here:

Forkio Figma Template: https://www.figma.com/design/9lLwBJciU4yjDZBSnqqXSS?fuid=1123869241213335204&prev-plan-id=1123869249756921170&prev-plan-type=team&prev-selected-view=recentsAndSharing

All spacing, coordinates, typography, and color codes are replicated from the provided Figma source to achieve an accurate match.

## Technologies Used
	•	HTML5 — Semantic markup and structure
	•	CSS3 — Layout, styling, and positioning (including absolute coordinates)
	•	Figma — Source design reference
	•	Google Fonts — Montserrat, Lato, and Roboto Mono families
